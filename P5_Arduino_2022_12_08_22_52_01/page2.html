                <h3>About</h3>
                <h1>The main purpose of this project, “Cocoon House”, is to give the viewer a way to transform a memory that affects their emotions into a product that is no longer personal. The work itself is a ritual with an intention to separate the memory that affects the individual emotionally, allowing them to confront their attachment anew as an outsider. Our memories often touch our emotions; images of the past which tend to dominate our lives and feelings, interfering with our emotions, enabling a stasis comprised of moments that we are unable to forget.</h1>
                <h2>The idea of this work is not to erase the past completely, but rather to convert the memory of the viewer into something “depersonalized”. By transforming the memory into another form, the individual can no longer interpret these moments as personal. This shift can change their perspective as well as confront the past and strip it of its affect in the present.</h2>
                <h3>Transformation Process</h3>
                <p>This conversion requires offline operation and/or submission to the operator, and the individual operating the process has to ensure that they cannot see the content of the submission.
                    The user enters their name (either real or anonymous) and clicks on “Formation” to create a memory cocoon of their own. The user then has to place the memory they want to convert, either in writing or in a photo, into the shredder. This action indicates that the memory will be transformed into data in the cocoon. Clicking on “Transform” then starts the shredder, and the operator will turn the shreds into a physical cocoon.
                    The entire process is saved as a video and can be accessed through the corresponding cocoon room on the website.</p>
                <h3>Why cocoons?</h3>
                <p>A cocoon is a natural process, non-transparent; the naked eye cannot see how the worm inside evolves, an unobservable form of transformation. We cannot know what exactly is inside this cocoon, but something is contained and changing inside. This ambiguous form emphasizes that the memory is no longer held by the individual; instead, it has been replaced by a recording of the cocoon’s creation. In this act of substitution is the clarification that no one has to be trapped by the past, and they can replace the memory as it once was with an image of rebirth.</p>
